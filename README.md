# Predicting-Depression-from-Social-Netwroking-Data-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

  This is a co-curricular Machine Learning project.
  
  Aim: To detect depression from the social networking data, with as much accuracy as possible.
  
  In this project we did the following things:
  
  * Data Scraping from different social forums.
  * Text Processing.
    * Extracting Basic Features
    * Count stopwords
    * Feature extraction
    * Lexical Diversity
    * Cleaning Data
  * Natural Language Processing techniques.
    * Frequent word removal.
    * Word Cloud.
    * N-grams.
    * POS Tagging.
    * Sentiment Analysis.
    * Topic Modelling.
    * TF-IDF 
  * Comparing performances of different prediction models.
    * Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
    * Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
    * K- Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
  
  Best results were shown by Multinomial Naive Bayes model, 99.69%.
  
  We also wrote a research paper for this project, which got accepted by the IEEE ICAC3N - 21 Scopus Indexed Conference, held in Dec, 2021.
